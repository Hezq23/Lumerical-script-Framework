# Lumerical-script-Framework
Integrated photonic simulation framework established by Hezq

##
Lumerical is the most popular integrated photonics simulation software. Its GUI and bulit-in language(we call it Lumerical language thereinafter) is easy to learn. However, the Lumerical language has many inherent drawbacks which may cause truble for integrated photonics designers. For some political reasons, lumerical official is not friendly to users in China. This, to some extent, hindering the development of integrated photonics industry 
in China. Now, we need to do something about it.  

##
Here demonstrates my simulation scripts for some of the PIC devices. Users can learn the the usage of Lumerical language for the complete integrated photonic simulation automation.
